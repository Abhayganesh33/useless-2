## 🚀 Project Description

This is not your grandfather's chess game.  
In DiceMaster Chess, you:

- Roll **one die** to choose a piece (Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, or Pawn)
- Roll **another die** to determine movement direction (Forward, Backward, Diagonal, etc.)
- Watch as the game unfolds in unpredictable ways!

Yes, we broke chess. You're welcome.

## ❓ The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

**"Chess is too logical."**  
Everyone's memorizing openings, studying endgames... boring!

---

## 💡 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

Let the dice decide for you!  
Forget strategy — embrace the randomness and let chaos reign on the 64 squares of fate.
